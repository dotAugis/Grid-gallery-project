# Grid-gallery-project
This is my very first project using HTML &amp; CSS. The goal of this project was to recreate Instagram's grid layout using grid and flexbox for sharing penguin images.

This project does not have any sort of JavaScript in it, as this was made before I touched on such a topic, but I am possibly interested in returning to this project to fully flesh it out in the future.
